# SquaredleSolver
Simple python script to solve squaredle. Doesn't take any input, but it does need the day's grid spelled out in the main section at the bottom--list them left-to-right, top-to-bottom.

Generates every word that can be found using the word list from https://github.com/dwyl/english-words

Note that it may take a while to run on larger grids to generate the longer words, and many of the words it finds aren't included in Squaredle--as obscure as some of the bonus words are, this list is even moreso.
